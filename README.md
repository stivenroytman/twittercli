# twittercli

---

## Purpose

To provide a programmatic and terminal-friendly way of interacting with twitter
without having to go through the hoops of getting their API key. While somebody
out there probaly already put something like this together, I don't care, I am
doing this for fun :)

## Usage

This package is still in its infancy, and much work still needs to be done to
create a simple and accessible user interface. Will check back here when there 
is more to say.

## In the works...

* A proper CLI for sending out a tweet. 
* Gathering, storing, and accessing tweets from your feed.
* Configuration management for password storing, etc.
